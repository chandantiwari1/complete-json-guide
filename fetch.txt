// As we know that DOM (Doucment object model ) manipulation is the browser featrure and its not the part of the any language itelft 

Similar javascript has many web api's which provides us functionality and to make our work easy 


           One example is the fetch api 


           fetch(.... Pass the Url).then(res=>{
               return res.json() /// 
           }).then(data=>{
               console.log(data);
           });


In the fetch api's you can also send the requrest with the credentials that are mentioned as follows 


fetch('https://example.com', {
  credentials: 'include'
});
